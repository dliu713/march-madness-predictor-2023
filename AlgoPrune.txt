Facts/Things to Know/Notes/Bias: https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/35719396/2023-march-madness-bracket-facts-men-ncaa-tournament
12.7 upsets per tournament (12-13)
6.1 upsets in the first round (7)
3.6 upsets in second round (3-4)
Sweet 16 1.7 (2)
Most common first round upsets: 10 over 7, 11 over 6, 12 over 5, 13 over 4, 14 over 3
Most common second round upsets: 6 over 3, 7 over 2, 10 over 2, 11 over 3, 8 over 1, 12 over 4

1st and 2nd:
Furman will lose
Marquette is shaky
Gonzaga won't lose in first round
Conference USA and MAC have early success
1 Top 4 seed loses in the first round
At least 1 first four team always makes it to at least the second round (Miss St, Pitt, Arizona St, Nevada)
If a 14 beats a 3, the 3 is Big 12 team (Baylor, Kansas St)
13 over 4 is usually close, pick at least 1 13 over 4
At least one 2 and one 3 seed will lose in second round
11 seed makes it out of the first round
At least one 12 over 5
Never been three straight 15 over 2 upsets
Teams finished 4 games under .500 don't lose in first round (West Virginia)
3 seeds beat 6 seeds but lose to 11 seeds in 2nd round
Auburn is 10-0 in first round

Sweet 16 and Elite 8:
Defending champions (Kansas) don’t last long (don't make elite 8)
At least one ACC team in sweet 16
At least one SEC elite 8 team
Pick one double digit seed in the sweet 16, usually an 11 seed
Mountain West never reaches elite 8
At least two teams seeded 6 or worse reach the elite 8
6 seeds don’t make the final four, much less the sweet 16

Final Four:
Arizona is rare
Xavier won't make it
3 consecutive final fours with a 3 seed
A 7 or lower seed always makes the final four (target 8 seed?)
2 one seeds make the final four
Teams that are a top 2 seed and top 10 ranked but were unranked entering the season don't reach final four (Purdue, Marquette)

Championship:
5-seeds have never won a championship (Duke, Miami FL, Saint Mary's, San Diego St)
1 seed wins the championship (Houston, Alabama, Purdue, Kansas)
Best team curse (Alabama historically sketchy too)
No loser of first game in conference tournament ever wins champ (Baylor, Kansas State)
Gonzaga sucks
Need a top 25 kenpom adjO and adjD (Houston, Alabama, Texas, UConn, UCLA, Purdue, Kansas, Creighton, A&M, FAU, Maryland, Memphis)

Big 12 is strongest conference, been on a historical tear (target Texas to go far?)
Purdue and West Virginia won’t win it all
Missouri is on four straight first round losses
When Kansas isn’t a 1 or 2 seed it underwhelms
Gonzaga will make the sweet 16 at least
Florida doesn’t lose in the first round
Creighton has never advanced past the second round
Colorado has one only 2 games in history
Clemson usually loses in the first round historically
BYU struggles in the tourney
Arkansas is 10-0 in the first round

Potential Cinderellas:
Colgate – mystery, snipers
Iona – best coach
Mount St. Mary’s – clutch
Oral Roberts – Max Abmas
UC-Santa Barbara – best mascot

THINGS I LEARNED:
-	Savage theory holds true – team with one superstar who can get hot will usually upset, Max Abmas, Preston
-	Go 7 first round upsets
-	Savages should pretty much always be NBA prospects, unless freakishly athletic or notoriously clutch
-	KenPom underrated teams are successful
